# abdatype

## What is it?
**abdatype** is my attempt at creating a speed typing test application that aims to improve the coding fluency of programmers (such as myself)! 
Developed using React, *abdatype* currently holds the ability to:
- Scroll through text dynamically as the user completes the test (with the help of our friend the caret '|').
- Provide immediate feedback based on the accuracy of the user through the highlighting of incorrect characters.
- Permit the customisation of test settings such as the theme, test time, and test type.
- Be aesthetically pleasing (UI inspiration was taken from not only [monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com/) but also some other amazing typing tests).
